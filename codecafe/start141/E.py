"""Perfect Prefixes
A permutation of length N is an array of length N that contains every integer from 1 to N exactly once.
For example, [1,3,2] and [2,1,3] are permutations of length 3, but [2,1,2] and [3,4,2] are not.

The beauty of a permutation P is defined to be the number of prefixes of P that are themselves permutations.
That is, it is the number of integers (1‚â§i‚â§N) such that the array [P1, P2, ‚Ä¶, Pi] is a permutation of length ùëñ.

You are given a permutation P of length N.
You can perform the following operation on it at most once:

Choose two integers L and R such that 1‚â§L<R‚â§N, and L and R have different parities.
That is, if L is odd then R should be even, and vice versa.
Then, for each i=L,L+2,L+4,‚Ä¶,R-1, swap Pi with Pi+1. 
In simpler words, you can choose a subarray of P that has even length, partition it into blocks of length 2, and swap the elements within each block.
For example, if P=[3,1,5,2,6,4] and you choose L=2 and R=5, the resulting permutation is P=[3,5,1,6,2,4].

Find the maximum possible beauty of P after performing at most one such operation.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N ‚Äî the length of the permutation.
The second line contains N space-separated integers P1, P2, ‚Ä¶,PN.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum possible beauty of P after performing at most one operation."""
